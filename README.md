# InMemoryDB

## Description
This project was designed to replicate transactions in the real world. It consists of a class with relevant functions and a series of tests* in main. 
* Instead of returning null I just returned -1 for values that could not be obtained. 

## Installation
Simply clone the repository to your local machine.

## Usage
To compile the code, run the following command:
```bash
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra memDB.cpp -o executable
./executable
```
## Modifications
In order to make this an official assignment I think it should be slightly more difficult with a new concept added in. Maybe something related to user authentication or networking concepts, because currently it was just a simple OOP problem. I think adding something such as encryption or verification over a local network would add another layer to this assignment that would also reflect the real world application.
